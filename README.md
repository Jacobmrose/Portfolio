# Jacob Rose's Portfolio

## Overview
This is my personal portfolio, designed to showcase my skills in modern web development while delivering an engaging interactive 3D experience. Built using React, TypeScript, Next.js, THREE.js, and TailwindCSS, this project highlights my expertise in front-end development and 3D web technologies.

## Technologies Used
- **Next.js** – Enables server-side rendering and performance optimizations.
- **React & TypeScript** – Provides a scalable, strongly-typed component architecture.
- **THREE.js** – Powers the interactive 3D graphics.
- **TailwindCSS** – Ensures efficient and responsive styling.

## Inspiration & References
This portfolio was inspired by [Adrian Hajdin's Three.js Portfolio](https://github.com/adrianhajdin/threejs-portfolio). While following a similar structure, I have implemented custom enhancements to tailor it to my vision and skillset.

## 3D Models & Attributions
To enhance the visual experience, I incorporated high-quality 3D models sourced from Sketchfab. Below are the models used along with their respective attributions:
