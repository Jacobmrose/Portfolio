# 🚀 Jacob Rose's Portfolio

## 🌟 Overview
This is my personal portfolio, designed to showcase my skills in modern web development while delivering an engaging interactive 3D experience. Built using **React**, **TypeScript**, **Next.js**, **THREE.js**, and **TailwindCSS**, this project highlights my expertise in front-end development and 3D web technologies.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- ⚡ **Next.js** – Enables server-side rendering and performance optimizations.
- ⚛️ **React & TypeScript** – Provides a scalable, strongly-typed component architecture.
- 🎮 **THREE.js** – Powers the interactive 3D graphics.
- 🎨 **TailwindCSS** – Ensures efficient and responsive styling.

## 🎨 Inspiration & References
This portfolio was inspired by [Adrian Hajdin's Three.js Portfolio](https://github.com/adrianhajdin/threejs-portfolio). While following a similar structure, I have implemented custom enhancements to tailor it to my vision and skillset.
